PRIVACY POLICY - Hide AI Overview Chrome Extension

Last updated: January 2026

SUMMARY
This extension collects no data whatsoever.

DATA COLLECTION
Hide AI Overview does not collect, store, transmit, or process any user data. The extension:
- Does not track browsing history
- Does not record search queries
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not use analytics or telemetry
- Does not communicate with any external servers
- Does not store any data locally or remotely

HOW IT WORKS
The extension runs entirely locally in your browser. It uses CSS and JavaScript to hide specific page elements (Google AI Overview and AI Mode features) from displaying. No data leaves your browser.

PERMISSIONS
The extension requires host permissions for google.com solely to modify page appearance. This permission is used exclusively to inject styling that hides AI-related elements.
